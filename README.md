# everforest-pecan-blairmod

This is a modified version of [talwat's Everforest theme](https://github.com/talwat/dotfiles) for [pecan](https://github.com/zzzeyez/pecan).

## Features

- Actual colours for CPU load, based on [icewind's Everforest theme for iTerm 2](https://github.com/icewind/everforest.iterm2)
- Date hackily moved to the right-hand side, merged with clock, to avoid the M1X MacBook Pro notch
